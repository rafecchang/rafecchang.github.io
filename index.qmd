Hello! This is Rafe; I am a recent graduate from the University of British Columbia. I studied data science- which is a lot of machine learning, statistics, and visualization, with some algorithm, database, and cloud computing. Besides data science, I am passionate in everything energy, with more in-depth knowledge in perovskite and the electricity grid. Currently learning about climate change at Terra.do!

Besides data and energy, I enjoy skiing, surfing, and house music;)
