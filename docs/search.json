    "text": "Professional Experience\nData Scientist (Capstone) @ Pacific Salmon Foundation\nTo support biologists in modeling salmon survival, I developed predictions for outmigration timing, enabling efficient resource allocation for tagging fish in rivers. My contributions included:\n\nWrote complex SQL queries to retrieve data from a relational database with 15 interconnected tables\nConducted exploratory data analysis for data cleaning and preprocessing with pandas\nExperimented with multiple modeling approaches, including SARIMAX, linear regression, and logistic regression, before selecting and developing a final XGBoost model\n\nBranding Strategy& Business Analytics Extern @ Beats by Dr. Dre\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of its advertisement among Gen Z audiences, I designed and conducted a comprehensive marketing research project. My contribution include:\n\nDesigned research framework based on conversion funnel; successfully sampling 5.57% of the target population to gather primary data\n\nAnalyzed result with hypothesis testing (chi-square analysis) and perceptual mapping (dimensionality reduction)\n\nStudent Consultant @ Union Pacific Railroad\nIn response to trends in deforestation, renewable diesel, and domestic electric vehicle production, I identified potential customers and developed logistic plans accordingly. My contribution include:\n\nAnalyzed the U.S. electrical vehicles market and fit linear modeling to extend on existing prediction\nResearched materials of various Lithium-Ion battery models; projected mineral demand by combining findings from electrical vehicle market analysis\nDeveloped logistic plans and estimated potential revenue after identifying the site locations along the battery production chain\n\nMarketing Specialist @ Nebraska College Rodeo Program\nIn the months leading up to the annual rodeo, the program sought ways to increase attendance; I boosted team members’ online presence. My contribution included:\n\nDeveloped webpage using HTML and CSS\nShoot, edited and posted content on Instagram; analyzed performance metrics to optimize engagement"
